# About KingFisher

Kingfisher is a simple Python 3 static code analyzer with the ability to add custom checks. 
It uses Python built-in modules `ast` and `tokenize` to parse and process the source code.

The analyzer is able to scan source code written in Python 3.4-3.9, but it requires Python 3.9 to work.

The full documentation for KingFisher is available at [GitHub Pages](https://artem94m.github.io/kingfisher/).
