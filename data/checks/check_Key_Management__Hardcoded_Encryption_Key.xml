    <description><![CDATA[Hardcoded encryption keys could compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.]]></description>
    <explanation><![CDATA[It is never a good idea to hardcode an encryption key. Not only does hardcoding an encryption key allow all of the project's developers to view the encryption key, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. After the code is in production, a software patch is required to change the encryption key. If the account protected by the encryption key is compromised, the owners of the system must choose between security and availability.
Example: The following code uses a hardcoded encryption key to encrypt information:

KF_CODE_EXAMPLE
...
from Crypto.Ciphers import AES
encryption_key = b'_hardcoded__key_'
cipher = AES.new(encryption_key, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')
...

This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the encryption key. After the program ships, there is likely no way to change the hardcoded encryption key _hardcoded__key_ unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to compromise data encrypted by the system.]]></explanation>
