    <description><![CDATA[Empty HMAC keys could compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.]]></description>
    <explanation><![CDATA[It is never a good idea to use an empty HMAC key. The cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the size of the secret key, which is used for the calculation and verification of the message authentication values. Using an empty key undermines the cryptographic strength of the HMAC function.

Example 1: The following code uses an empty key to compute the HMAC:

KF_CODE_EXAMPLE
import hmac
...
mac = hmac.new("", plaintext).hexdigest()
...

The code in Example 1 may run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will be able to figure out that it uses an empty HMAC key. After the program ships, there is likely no way to change the empty HMAC key unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information could use it to compromise the HMAC function. Also, the code in Example 1 is vulnerable to forgery and key recovery attacks.]]></explanation>
