    <description><![CDATA[Null encryption keys can compromise security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.]]></description>
    <explanation><![CDATA[Assigning None to encryption key variables is a bad idea because it can allow attackers to expose sensitive and encrypted information. Not only does using a null encryption key significantly reduce the protection afforded by a good encryption algorithm, but it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. After the offending code is in production, a software patch is required to change the null encryption key. If an account protected by the null encryption key is compromised, the owners of the system must choose between security and availability.

Example: The following code initializes an encryption key variable to null.

KF_CODE_EXAMPLE
...
from Crypto.Ciphers import AES
cipher = AES.new(None, AES.MODE_CFB, iv)
msg = iv + cipher.encrypt(b'Attack at dawn')
...

Anyone who has access to the code would be able to determine that it uses a null encryption key, and anyone employing even basic cracking techniques is much more likely to successfully decrypt any encrypted data. After the program ships, a software patch is required to change the null encryption key. An employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even if attackers only had access to the application's executable, they could extract evidence of the use of a null encryption key.]]></explanation>
